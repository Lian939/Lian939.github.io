## Summary
The Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT) tested the efficacy of lowering cholesterol levels in reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in 3,806 asymptomatic, middle-aged men with primary hypercholesterolemia. The trial randomized participants to cholestyramine resin (a bile acid sequestrant) plus diet or placebo plus diet for an average of 7.4 years. This article was the first part of the CPPT trial results. In this paper, the author presented the design and the results of the clinical trial. The group treated with cholestyramine had 8.5% and 12.6% greater reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein levels, respectively, than those achieved in the placebo group. The cholestyramine group experienced a 19% reduction in risk of the primary endpoint (definite CHD, death or definite nonfatal myocardial infarction). The risk of death from all causes was only slightly and not significantly reduced in the cholestyramine group.

## Reaction
In my view, this clinical trial is well-designed and conduct very well. The results of this clinical trial have considerable importance for the prevention of CHD through cholesterol lowering. This randomized, double-blind study could wash out the population bias and use well known statistical tools to analysis the results. Using the permuted block method is a good way to gain in precision. Comparing treatments within strata, the variation between strata is eliminated and the treatment groups guaranteed to be fairly well balanced on stratum characteristics. Also, to get more conclusive result, several statistical methods were used to monitor the trial. Comparing with previous trials of cholesterol lowering was very interesting, and we could get general ideas about the inconclusive reasons. However, this study provides no evidence that the cholestyramine treatment would be beneficial in hyperlipidemic women or those who are either younger or older than the participants in this trial. Therefore, we need take extreme caution to extrapolate these results to other people. 

### Questions
1. The advantage and disadvantage of Permuted block randomization, and how do we define the stratification variables?
2. Are there any bias to only include participants with preponderantly college- or high school-educated whites?
3. When should we use the intention to treat analysis? How to control noncompliant and dropouts?
4. Why the life-table curves show the benefit of treatment became apparent two years after initial treatment in both categories of primary end points?
