## Summary
In the mid-1800s, London physician John Snow made a startling observation that would change the way that we view diseases and how they propagate. In his book “On the Mode of Communication of Cholera”, he talked about the history of cholera, the pathology of cholera, the influence factor, the evidence and instances. The study involved some 300,000 people, from all occupations, social standing, ages and genders. There are many statistical results in this book.  Although Dr. Snow could not identify the culprit under his microscope, the bean-shaped bacteria Vibrio cholera that thrives in brackish water, he created a map depicting where cases of cholera occurred in London’s West End and found them to be clustered around a water pump on Broad Street.

## Reaction
From my perspective, I think the map is really great and is a tremendous contribution to the field of epidemiology. Because Dr. Snow realized that part of the requirement to treat diseases is not to treat patients as individual isolated cases, but to treat patients as living in a larger environment. Meantime, it is very interesting to find that dry weather could promote cholera. But the author only mentioned that the reason might be the evacuations of the patients keep accumulating in the river along with the other impurities. The association between the mortality from cholera in the different districts of London in 1849 and the elevation of the ground is very interesting. The connection being of an inverse kind, the higher districts suffering least, and the lowest suffering most from this malady. This is a remarkable coincidence discovered by Dr. Farr. He thought the level of the soil had some direct influence over the prevalence of cholera, but some facts are contrary to this conclusion. I think this is the charm of epidemiological research.

### Questions
1.	Dry weather could promote cholera, why there is another peak of prevalence of endemic cholera during the wet weather?
2.	Dr. Snow believes that the symptoms commence in the intestinal canal, and that the disease is entirely local, and that neither the blood nor the nervous system are primarily affected. Is it correct?
3.	The author mentioned that if cholera were a communicable disease, women ought to suffer in much greater numbers than the men, as they were employed in nursing the sick. Is it true?
