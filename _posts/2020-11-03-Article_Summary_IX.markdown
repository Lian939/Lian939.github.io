## Summary
Ryan and colleagues performed a medication-wide association study (MWAS) and scanned 88 to 118 drugs in a case-control setting in cohorts derived from large claims of 46 million patients and electronic health record databases of 11 million patients focusing on associations for four acute outcomes (including myocardial infarction, acute liver failure, acute renal failure and upper gastrointestinal bleeding). For each drug-outcome pair, they performed a self-controlled case series (SCCS) analysis. They illustrated a proof-of-concept method for signal generation, which allows standardized monitoring of specific health outcomes of interest to all medical products. The results showed that most of the signals generated from four clinically important Adverse Drug Event (ADE) outcomes were positive controls. For each outcome, many drugs that were known to have no side effects, had significant statistical associations. On the contrary, many drugs that were known to be effective did not give a signal. After grouped by organ system, the effects of these drugs in each group were similar. These findings suggested that observational databases were useful for identifying potential associations that warranted further consideration but were unlikely to provide definitive evidence of causal effects. 

## Reaction
This study used databases maintained by one site to carry out a MWAS, assessing whether drugs with similar function or structure cause similar side effects, which offered a good way to visualize the post-market effects of pharmaceutical drugs better. MWAS visualization using an SCCS analysis across multiple databases provides a framework that embodies several of the elements required for evaluating a potential causal effect, including strength of association, consistency, temporality, specificity, and coherence. Integration of different sources of information, such as electronic health records and medical literature, is an option that can offer good results in the generation of improved surveillance systems and could offer tremendous potential in providing credible evidence for advancing our understanding of the effects of medical products across large populations and a wide variety of products. I agreed with that using P-values to prioritize possible drug-adverse event associations was problematic, and even with multiple testing corrections it was not possible to remove false positives. This method in this paper, although capable of generating an enriched subset of ADE candidates, showed some limitations in its ability to exclude some false positives from the final signal selection.

### Questions
1. In Figure 2, what does it mean if the percentile of the negative control drugs above or below the black dashed line?
2. The results showed that different health-care databased exhibited similar biases. What these biases might be and how to avoid? 
3. How to effectively incorporate some forms of relevant information, such as prior knowledge of known ADEs?
4. Why not too many studies use whole-drug association analysis?
