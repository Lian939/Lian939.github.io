## Summary
Deep learning methods have been applied to biology and medicine for several decades, but recently the field has seen a true explosion of interest because of several important advances, such as easy-to-use software packages, new techniques for fast training, and larger datasets now available are also sufficient for fitting the many parameters. [Ching et al.(2018)](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rsif.2017.0387) reviewed applications of deep learning to a variety of biomedical problems, including patient classification, fundamental biological processes and treatment of patients, and discussed whether deep learning would be able to transform these tasks or if the biomedical sphere posed unique challenges. In this review, at first, the authors asked a question "Will deep learning transform the study of human disease?", and concluded that deep learning had not revolutionized biomedicine or definitively resolved any of the most pressing challenges in the field, but promising advances had been made on the prior state of the art after reviewing the improvements, contribution, barriers and challenges of deep learning application in biology and medicine. 

## Reaction
This review provides a very comprehensive overview of the biological and medical applications of deep learning, as well as a summary of the challenges that have been solved and are being faced. Although there are already a number of reviews focused on applications of deep learning in biology, healthcare and drug discovery, this review highlight cases where deep learning enabled researchers to solve challenges that were previously considered infeasible or made difficult, tedious analyses routine, and identified approaches that researchers are using to sidestep challenges posed by biomedical data. The challenges, such as uncertainty quantification, interpretability, limited amount of labelled data, hardware limitations, legal and privacy, etc. remains open, but I think machine learning and deep learning are influencing our everyday lives in numerous ways (e.g. facial recognition, predictive analytics). I’m really optimistic about this. Just like steam power, electricity and digital automation of the past, these technologies will bring a new revolution to the world. Also, the transfer learning and representation learning is interesting, and these technologies and algorithms will be very useful after overcoming the limitations (e.g. no established theoretical guarantees for feature transferability between distant domains, imbalance).

## Questions
1. What’s the benefits and limitations of transfer learning?
2. What do we need to create a mature and production-ready framework for drug repositioning via deep learning?
3. When combined or replicated studies across systems, is it possible to delete local bias, wider standards and legal issues?
4. What are the most significant challenges to implement machine learning or deep learning, and will perceived redundancy or unemployment be a big threat?
