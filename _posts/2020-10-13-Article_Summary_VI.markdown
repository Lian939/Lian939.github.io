## Summary
This Berry commentary provided new analyses and evaluations to address some important issue in the question of whether or not to recommend regular mammography to women aged 40–49 years. The author presented a meta-analysis of the eight randomized trials that allows for differences between the trials and that addresses an individual woman’s decision more appropriately than do the existing analyses. Also, the writer provided ways of presenting the benefits and risks of mammography that would help women and their caregivers in making screening decisions. The results based on Mantel-Haenzel likelihood function and two Bayesian analysis showed 18% reduction in breast cancer mortality at 15 years and beyond, and 3.8 years per 1000 women or 1.4 days per woman increased in life expectancy. However, some issues have been found in these randomized trials, including lack of compliance, data quality and analysis. The benefit of the screening was a possible delay in death and increase in life expectancy. The risks included false-positive findings, inconvenience, pain, and anxiety. But not all commonly cited risks should be considered when comparing the benefits and risks, because potential mortality benefits have been considered these risks. 

## Reaction
The commentary by Donald a. Berry provided new analyses and evaluations of the evidence for screening mammography for women in their forties. In addition, it addressed the question of communicating the potential benefits and risks of screening to women and their caregivers. The author mentioned the view of significance testing is restricted in four issues and the heterogeneity problem of Mantel-Haenszel test, a standard statistical analysis of multiple screening trials. Therefore, he used Bayesian analysis using hierarchical modeling. And the predictive distribution in the next trial is directly relevant for an individual woman’s decision. The writer thought of screening as a lottery. Any winnings were shared by the minority of women who are diagnosed with breast cancer in their forties. The overwhelming majority of women experience no benefit. It is interesting but it’s really hard for a woman to decide whether screening is appropriate. In addition, I could not agree with that power calculations were irrelevant. 

### Questions
1. Participants skipped their assigned mammograms about 20% of the time, and some participants assigned to be control subjects opted to have screening mammograms. Does Bayesian analysis account for this? Women at lower risk of breast cancer may have skipped mammograms, and women at higher risk may have sought them out. How could we explain the influence on the result?
2. What do the results mean that some trials receive the greatest adjustments and some trials not?
3. The author stated that there was no evidence from the trials that a yearly schedule was beneficial and the results might overestimate the benefits of screening in their forties. Do we need separate study in comparing yearly schedule vs twice yearly schedule and age 40-44 years vs age 45-49 years?
