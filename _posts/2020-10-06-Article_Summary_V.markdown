## Summary
In this issue, Hernán et al reanalyzed Nurses’ Health Study (NHS) Data on hormone therapy and heart disease using an observational analog of intention-to-treat (ITT) to compare the NHS with the Women’s Health Initiative Trial estimates. They assessed the extent to which differences (different distributions of time since menopause, length of follow-up, and analytic approach) other than randomized differences affect the difference between observational and randomized effect estimates. The main finding is hormone therapy may increase the long-term CHD risk only in women who were 10 or more years after menopause at initiation. The resulting common HR estimates agreed closely with corresponding estimates from the WHI trial with HR estimate (95% CI) of 1.42 (0.92–2.20) for the first 2 years of use, and 0.96 (0.78 –1.18) over the entire follow-up period. And much of the apparent WHI-NHS difference disappeared after stratification by time since menopause at hormone therapy initiation. However, the ITT estimates indicate that any remaining differences between NHS and WHI estimates cannot be explained by unmeasured combined risk factors for coronary heart disease and treatment interruption. But the misclassification and length of follow-up might explain the difference.

## Reaction
The paper by Herna´n et al proposed innovative methods for analyzing data from clinical trials and observational cohort studies in a comparable manner. They confirmed previous analysis and speculations that the differences between the NHS and WHI lie in different risks by duration of follow-up, the interval between menopause and initiation of hormone therapy. Both clinical trials and observational study have advantage and disadvantage, comparing them could examine the consistency of results, and identify improvements in study design, conduct, or analysis. In addition, the pooled analysis could increase the power. Also, the author computed a possible interaction (P = 0.08) between hormone therapy and years since menopause. Such an interaction was not evident in the WHI trial and would benefit from study in other settings. However, I think it’s too strict that the author said, “ITT effect estimates may be unsatisfactory when studying the efficacy, and inappropriate when studying the safety, of an active treatment compared with no treatment.”

### Questions
1. Can we generalize this analysis and how?
2. When should we do adherence adjustment? If we have a time-varying exposure, should we always do adherence adjustment to deal with the time-varying confounding?
3. How to choose the change of start of follow-up (time of therapy initiation vs. time of questionnaire return), and the change of the exposed group (selected initiators vs. current users)?
