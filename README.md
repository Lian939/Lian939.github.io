## Summary
In this paper, Gelman et al. went through seven interesting and representative examples of tables from the March 2000 issue of the Journal of the American Statistical Association to study the question: Could graphs do better? The conclusion from most of these studies was that main motivation for displaying numerical information in statistics articles is to make comparisons, and for this purpose, the well-designed graphs are superior to tables. The authors identified some key ideas to construct the graphs and the steps for most data displays in statistical research were: (1) identify the key comparisons of interest; (2) display these on small individual plots with comparison lines or axes where appropriate; and (3) establish enough control over the graphical display so that small legible plots can be juxtaposed as necessary. Besides the general recommendations about the kinds of plots that worked well for presenting the results of statistical research, they supplied several specific suggestions about the placement of graphs, the use of labels and baselines, and other details that are crucial in constructing small yet readable graphical displays. 

## Reaction
The interesting part is that nice graphs are possible, especially when we think hard about why we want to display these numbers in the first place. The summary and regression results are almost always presented in table and my first impression is that tables are the best way to display these data. But if we think more about why we might present descriptive statistics, the most important might be to give an audience a sense of the data in order to lay a foundation for subsequent statistical analyses, then the graphing descriptive statistics might be a superior choice. Because graphs allow for easy comparison of variables, which can be important for assessing regression analyses, and make it much easier to compare variables across two or more settings, such as different gender, time periods and subgroups. Moreover, I realize the graphs can also improve the communication of regression results, for example, the graphs could allow for the proper highlighting of effect size and comparison of coefficient both within and across models. 

### Questions
1.	How to construct an accurate, concise and clear graph, and where to find relevant reference materials?
2.	Could graphs replace tables in statistical analysis?
